#Fintech Case Study - The case for Theta as the leading media and entertainment blockchain

## Overview and Origin ##

### Name of Company? ###

Theta Labs

### When was the company incorporated? ###

Theta labs was incorporated in 2017

### Who are the Founders of the company? ###

Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? ###

Mitch and Jeiyi had previously created Sliver.tv (now known as theta.tv) was a large virtual reality 360 production that pushed streamers world wide, rendering games into fully immersive VR streams in the esports space. They had initial backing from Samsung VR and Sony. They identified that CDN costs accounted for 30-40% of their operational costs and this became a pain point of their company. Sony and Samsung asked if they could leverage the use of blockchain to solve this pain point and to help other companies in the entertainment streaming space.

In this video Mitch Liu discusses how Theta Labs came about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJumYrFOy0

## Business Activities ##

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? ###

**Theta aims to:**
Reduce the streaming-related costs of content distribution networks
make distribution more seamless and reliable through a peer-to-peer decentralized streaming infrastructure relaying not only video but data, compute, storage and other functions.
Increase user engagement and monetisation through NFTs.

The below picture shows the traditional method of how content is distributed to the viewer. A common problem is an overloaded centralised CDN and this will continue to rise as quality of content increases. According to CISCO, video streaming accounts for ⅔ of internet demand and is predicted to increase to 82% in the next few years.

The diagram below depicts how Theta Labs aims to help distribute content to the viewers. They arent trying to replace CDNs but rather assist in the “last mile” of delivery where viewer nodes can pull stream from caching nodes that are geographically closer than the CDN servers, resulting in better streaming quality.

### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Theta has multiple customers that they can attract across several sectors.

One of Theta's intended customer is an enterprise streaming service such as: Youtube, Netflix, HBO, Disney Plus, Hulu.

The content Delivery network market size was $11.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $95.37 billion dollars by 2030. (PR Newswire)

Theta could reduce CDN costs by up to 90% while improving delivery. 

Additionally they can increase user engagement through the monetization of NFT’s and collectibles  that are earnt for watching metrics such as watching a movie multiple times or completing a box set of a show or watching a live stream.
These NFT’s can then be sold/traded on Theta’s marketplace thetadrop.com which can then be passed back to content creators and streaming companies creating additional revenue for them.

Theta could also attract film studios, branded IP owners, talent agencies or content creators. “Our ultimate brand partnership would include an exclusive live stream of the event on the Theta platform powered by Theta P2P streaming technology enabling fans to earn TFUEL for sharing bandwidth, real-time NFT drops and exclusive VIP benefits to TDROP holders”

For example a new artist that wants to launch a new song could:
Live premiere their song on a video network such as Youtube, Amazon Prime, Netflix via which is powered by powered by Theta’s streaming infrastructure
Fans can receive lifetime NFTs which provides additional incentive to tune in to watch and increase the user experience
They can provide some form of utility such as future invites, exclusive access to videos or merchandise

The global entertainment and media market is expected to reach $6.7 trillion USD by 2030 (Tdrop Whitepaper)

NFT sales in 2021 was $17.7 billion and is forecasted to to be over $80 billion by 2025. (Coindesk 1)

### What Solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) ###

Theta is the leading media and entertainment blockchain and poses an advantage over the competition through the following key areas which highlight the comprehensive ecosystem that they have created:


Theta Community

The Theta community consists of Enterprise Validators including Samsung, Sony, Google, Creative Artists Agency, Binance, Blockchain.com

This gives Theta a competitive edge as they are able to leverage these relationships to initiate strategic discussions with other multinational technology and entertainment firms while providing credibility to new investors.

Theta Development Community

Theta labs has created and developed a range of dev tools to accelerate development while also running Theta Hackathons to incentivize development. 

Theta is Ethereum compatible which means any Ethereum application can be migrated over to the Theta network and run seamlessly with little to none code changes. This is important as this could help attract Ethereum developers  who are focused on the entertainment and media service as Theta is faster, lower in cost to use and greener than Ethereum and Ethereum has the highest number of blockchain developers.(Chain Debrief)

Thetas Patents

Theta Labs have 6 granted patents in this space with 14 more pending.

The complete list can be shown here: https://patents.justia.com/inventor/jieyi-long

One patent that was awarded was to use NFTs for decentralized DRM (digital rights management). This technology allows easy management across multiple entertainment domains such as live performances and concerts while allowing the user a one of a kind ticket verified by the blockchain and can grant owners special items, backstage passes etc. 

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? ###

Technologies that Theta Labs is using include:

Multi-BFT Consensus - Allows thousands of nodes to participate in the consensus process, and supports very high transaction throughput.
Aggregated Signature Gossip Scheme  - Leverages a non-interactive leaderless BLS signature aggregation scheme
Resource-Oriented Micropayment Pool - Allowing a viewer to create a “micropayment pool that any account can withdraw from without needing to pre-specify which accounts and to ensure this approach is double-spend resistant
(Medium Theta)

## Landscape ##

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in? ###

Theta labs is in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? ###

Blockchain has seen a faster growth rate than the growth rate of the internet in the late 1990s. Bitcoin has the same number of users as the internet had in 1997 however the difference is that the adoption rate has been much higher. In four years, it is forecasted that Bitcoin will have 1 billion users.

This technology pioneered by bitcoin has been making its way through all industries with companies exploring blockchain technology to see how it can be applied to streamline their operations, reduce costs, transactions safe, improve security and ensure product safety.

Theta helped launch an exclusive set of NFTs for Katy Perry for her upcoming residency at Resorts World Las Vegas. Her NFT Collection raised $1.2 million in primary sales and $860,000 in the secondary market. This is the first of many other celebrities to follow suit and launch their own NFTs on Theta’s network. (Crypto Slate)

Theta has integrated premium content to Theta.tv from Hollywood studios like Lionsgate, MGM, Jukin Media and Cinedigm. 

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? ###

**Marketcap and token price** - The Theta token price was at an all time low in March 2020 of $0.04 and rose to an all time high of $15.72 on Apr 16, 2021. It has since retraced back to $3.18 and currently has a market cap of $3.2 Billion. Despite the retracement the current price is still 80x higher than that 2 years ago showing a greater demand and interest in this company.(Coingecko 1) 

**Partnerships and Large Companies onboarded** - One, World Poker Tour, Party Poker, Lionsgate, MGM, Cinedigm, ConTV, Gumi, GFuel TV 
Money saved from using their technology

**Money generated from launching celebrity NFTs** - $2 Million generated in primary and secondary sales with Katy Perry’s NFT launch

Based on the above metrics, Theta has achieved significant milestones by successfully demonstrating that their peer to peer distribution technology works, to generating $2 million in sales from their first celebrity NFT launch to onboarding significant companies in the entertainment space. This is just the start of what they can achieve as they now have a successful portfolio to pitch to future clients.

## Recommendations ##

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) ###

 I would recommend to build cross chain bridges with other Layer 1 blockchains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Atom, Terra Luna, Matic, Binance Smart Chain.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? ###

This would enable smart contracts, data exchanges and token transfers between other layers 1’s without the need for a Centralized Exchange. By building a cross chain bridge with other Layer 1’s that would incentivise other projects on other networks to port over and build on the Theta network resulting in a bigger Theta ecosystem

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? ###

Smart Contracts would be used to build the bridge to make sure the transfer of tokens and data are able to move accurately between Layer 1’s.  

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? ###

Smart Contracts would be appropriate for the solution as they are a set of properly written code that can automatically execute, control and document independently without a third party.
